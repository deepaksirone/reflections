Viewing a diff helped find bugs between two versions of a file, by showing the line numbers where the corresponding files changed.

Looking through them we can spot the bug.
Use short lines to have the diff be more
effective.

Easy access to the entire history of a file
gives fast access to changes, which can be tried out
induvidually. Hence making me a better programmer.

Manual saving means that we can create versions having meaning.

Multi file commits can be used to store a whole snapshot of the current
repository and it can be used with git diff to view the changes in both the
commits.

Multi File commits allow users to store changes in files that are
interconnected.

Viewing history can be done by git log --stat or git log
git diff <commitid 1> <commit id2> can be done to compare 2 commits

Git makes me more confident to make mistakes because I can always checkout previous
states before commits using git checkout <commit id> 

I want to use git for writing my projects from now on. :)
