When initializing a repository, git creates a .git file and it contains all the metadata for the git repository. 
Initially there are no commits.

Initialize a repository using git init. and check the status using git status.

The working directory contains the repository and the .git directory.

The staging area has all the files that are to be included in the next commit. We can choose to add the files which we want to take a snapshot of.
